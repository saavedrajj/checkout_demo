# Checkout.com - Implementation Engineering Tech Test

## Coding task

You Are a merchant selling T-shirts in the UK and Germany. You currently process card
payments, so you want a payment solution that allows you to capture the card details on your
checkout page securely while maintaining PCI Compliance. You also heard of a popular
German bank transfer payment method that you are interested in offering. Based on your
platformâ€™s analytics, most of the customers visiting your website are using an Android mobile

also providing some kind of one-touch payment.
